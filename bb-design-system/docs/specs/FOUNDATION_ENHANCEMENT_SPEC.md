#### 3.3 Advanced Theming Features

**Objective**: Support complex theming scenarios

**Tasks**:
- ‚è≥ Theme inheritance and composition
- ‚è≥ Conditional theme logic
- ‚è≥ Dynamic theme generation from brand colors
- ‚è≥ Theme analytics and usage tracking

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All code must pass strict TypeScript compilation
2. **Unit Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage for all new features
3. **Documentation**: All public APIs must have comprehensive JSDoc comments
4. **Performance**: No performance regressions allowed
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance required for all features

### Design Principles

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Features should degrade gracefully
2. **Performance First**: Optimize for runtime performance over convenience
3. **Developer Experience**: APIs should be intuitive and well-documented
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility with existing implementations
5. **Standards Compliance**: Follow Angular and Material Design guidelines

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Jest-based testing for service logic
2. **Integration Tests**: Angular Testing Library for component integration
3. **Visual Tests**: Storybook-based visual regression testing
4. **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse CI for bundle size and performance
5. **Accessibility Tests**: Automated a11y testing with axe-core

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Risk Areas

1. **CSS Custom Property Support**: Older browsers may have limited support
   - **Mitigation**: Provide SCSS fallbacks for critical properties

2. **Bundle Size Growth**: Additional features may increase bundle size
   - **Mitigation**: Tree-shaking and modular architecture

3. **Theme Switching Performance**: Complex themes may cause performance issues
   - **Mitigation**: CSS property batching and optimization

### Medium Risk Areas

1. **Breaking Changes**: API evolution may break existing implementations
   - **Mitigation**: Semantic versioning and deprecation warnings

2. **Browser Compatibility**: Advanced CSS features may not work everywhere
   - **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement and feature detection
