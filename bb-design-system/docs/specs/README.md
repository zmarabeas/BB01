## üéØ Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Extraction (High Priority)
- [ ] Create Angular library structure for foundation
- [ ] Extract theme service to standalone library
- [ ] Package design tokens as distributable SCSS
- [ ] Set up build pipeline for foundation library

### Phase 2: Component Theming (High Priority)  
- [ ] Ensure comprehensive Material component coverage
- [ ] Create consistent theming patterns
- [ ] Implement proper dark mode support
- [ ] Add accessibility enhancements

### Phase 3: Developer Experience (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Create NPM package for easy installation
- [ ] Build comprehensive documentation site
- [ ] Provide CLI tools for theme generation
- [ ] Create interactive theme builder

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Low Priority)
- [ ] Theme marketplace and sharing
- [ ] Advanced animation theming
- [ ] Performance optimization tools
- [ ] Visual regression testing
